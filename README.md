# Map ResourceRef Playground

This repository is a **standalone React playground** for exploring how community-owned map data, storytelling, and ResourceRef concepts can work together — outside of the main platform while core infrastructure is still being built.

This repo is intentionally structured around **Challenge-Based Learning**. Each challenge introduces a new concept:
- Maps
- Interaction
- Storytelling
- Timelines
- Media
- Satellite imagery
- And eventually governance-style resource referencing

This space is designed for:
- Experimentation
- Skill-building
- Creative exploration
- Teaching younger students real-world mapping + storytelling concepts

## 🌍 Why This Exists

Future Ancestors Alliance and the Wáadluwaan / Sgaawaay platform are focused on:
- Protecting language
- Preserving community knowledge
- Building Native-led digital tools
- Teaching youth real technology skills tied to culture

This repo allows developers and students to:
- Learn modern mapping libraries
- Practice React development
- Explore storytelling through geographic data
- Experiment without touching the production platform
- Prepare future features that will later plug into ResourceRef

## 🧭 How This Repo Is Used

This is NOT a finished product.
This is a:
- Learning lab
- Mapping sandbox
- Prototype playground

Each “Challenge” builds on the previous one.

The early challenges focus on:
- Rendering maps
- Switching between libraries
- Clicking points
- Displaying information

Later challenges add:
- Timelines
- Family occupancy
- Media stories
- Satellite views

Eventually these ideas will be carried into the main platform using **ResourceRef governance rules**.

## 🧩 Challenge-Based Development

All work in this repo is organized into sequential challenges:

- Challenge 1 — Map Playground React App + Multi-Library Spike  
- Challenge 2 — Clickable Map Points with Story Panel  
- Challenge 3 — Family Timeline Slider  
- Challenge 4 — Now & Then Media Viewer  
- Challenge 5 — Satellite View Toggle  

Each challenge:
- Introduces a real-world concept
- Teaches a practical skill
- Builds toward community storytelling + future governance

## 🧒 Youth & Student Learning Layer

This repo is also designed to be used by **younger students** after Challenge 1 is complete.

Students can:
- Add their own map points
- Create stories
- Learn coordinates
- Explore geography
- Attach photos
- See how digital storytelling works

Special **Student Micro-Challenges** are included to support this.

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This repo is **separate from the main platform** by design.
- No sensitive or cultural data should be added here.
- Student work can be fictional or based on safe public locations.
- This is a **training and prototyping space**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Once Challenge 1 is complete:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
